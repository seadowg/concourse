\title{\code{attempts}\aux{: retry a step}}{retry-step}

Any step can set the number of times it should be attempted by attaching
an \code{attempts} parameter with the number of times it should be tried.

\define-attribute{attempts: integer}{
  The total number of times a step should be tried should it fail, e.g. \code{5}
  will try the step up to 5 times before giving up.

  When the number of attempts is reached and the step has still not succeeded
  then the step will fail.
}

Attempts will retry on a Concourse error as well as build failure.

The following will run the task, and retry it 9 times (for a total of 10
attempts) if it fails:

\codeblock{yaml}{
plan:
- get: foo
- task: unit
  file: foo/unit.yml
  attempts: 10
}
